Hey all! I am an incoming PhD student at UCB Sky Lab. My research interest lies around providing **system** support for emerging applications like **machine learning** and **multimedia**. I graduated from University of Chicago with BS in Math and CS (both honors), mainly working with Prof. Junchen Jiang. 

I am currently working on LLM serving, including [LMCache](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache) and [vLLM Production Stack](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack). Let me know if you are interested in learning more about serving open-source LLM efficiently or contributing!

My previous research included video conferencing, and I was one of the very first people to optimize KV cache reuse for LLMs.
