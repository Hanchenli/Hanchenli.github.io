I am a 1st year PhD student at [UCB Sky Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/) advised by Prof. Ion Stoica and Prof. Joseph Gonzalez. My current research focus lies broadly in **systems** and **AI**. Previously, I graduated from University of Chicago with BS in Math and CS (both honors), mainly working with Prof. Junchen Jiang. 

I write about technology, business, and society at my cute blog [site](https://hanchenli.github.io/blog/). The best way to follow me is on Twitter or Linkedin!

In previous life, I was the first employee of Tensormesh (creator of LMCache), where I led Product and Growth in the beginning. I was one of the very first people to optimize KV cache reuse beyond GPU HBM for LLMs (The Cache papers). 

I am open to collaborations and working with undergraduate students with excellence and tenacity. Please checkout the [collaborations page](/collaborations/) if you are interested!

## Life
* My name in Chinese is 李翰宸 and I grew up in Nanjing, Jiangsu.
* I play soccer, basketball, tennis, and lift. I enjoyed 掼蛋(Guan Dan, a popular card game in ~~Jiangsu~~China) with friends but now I got back to reading.
