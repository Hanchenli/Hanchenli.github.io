I am a rising third year undergraduate at University of Chicago studying Mathematics (Honors), Computer Science (Honors) and Statistics. My research interest lies around providing **system & networking** support for **multimedia** and **machine learning** applications. <br /> I am currently researching on LLM serving and real-time communication for emergin multimedia applications including LLM and video conferencing.

I have been fortunate to work with Prof. Junchen Jiang at University of Chicago and collaborate with Dr. Amrita Mazumdar from NVIDIA research. Here is my [cv]()<br />
