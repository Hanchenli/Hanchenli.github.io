  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>If you think I can be helpful for your project or you are looking for a project. Feel free to shoot me an email.</p>

  <h2>For undergraduate students</h2>

  <p>I have some ideas on projects around AI and Systems. 
  Previous collaborations with more junior researchers have resulted in paper like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07174">HypoEval</a>. 
  Most projects require at least 15-20 hours a week for half a year or 30-40 hours a week for 3 months. 
  If you are interested, feel free to shoot me an email with your background and your interest (Resume, Transcript, and optional Github account). </p>
