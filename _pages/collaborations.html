  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>If you think I can be helpful for your project or you are looking for a project. Feel free to shoot me an email.</p>

  <h2>For undergraduate students</h2>

  <p>
  Previous collaborations with more junior researchers have resulted in paper like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07174">HypoEval</a>. 
  Most projects require significant effort outside school work so you should expect long-term commitment (20-30h/week for 3-6months).
  If you are interested, feel free to shoot me an email with your background and your interest (Resume, Transcript, and optional Github account).
